If we prepare any java Application on the basis of client-server architecture , then that application is called Distributed Application.
To prepare Distributed Application we have 
1)  Socket Programming
2)  RMI


If we want to prepare distributed applications by using Socket Programming then we 
have to use Sockets between machines to transfer data from one machine to another machine.
* Socket is a Channel or medium to transfer data from one machine to another machine.
* In Socket programming we have to establish Sockets on the basis of System IP Address and Port Numbers.

Steps for Socket Programming at client end:
--------------------------------------------

1) create a socket at Client Machine :  Socket so = new Socket(IP, port);
2) get OutputStream from Socket : OutputStream os = so.getOutsputStream()
3) Create PrintStream with outputStream :  PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(os);
4) Send data to printStream : String data ="hello"; ps.println(data);

* with the above steps data will be sent to server;

  now receive data from Server:
  
 5) InputStream is = so.getInputStream();
 6) read inputstream with bufferedreader : BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new inputStreamReader(is));
 7) readdata from bufferedReader; String data  = br.readline();
 
 
 Steps to prepare Server Application:
 ------------------------------------
 
 1) get inputStream from socket:  InputStream is = s.getInputStream();
 2) create BufferedReader with InputStream : BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
 3)readdata from BufferedReader : String data = br.readLine();
 4)get outputstream from socket : OutputStream os = s.getOutputStream();
 5) create PrintStream with outputStream(); PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(os);
 6)send data to printStream() : ps.println("hello");
